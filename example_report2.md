### US-11622536-B2: Pet nail caps

#### Abstract
Pet nail caps cover pets&#39; nails to prevent scratches on surfaces (e.g., hardwood and tiled flooring) and avoid injuries to themselves and others (e.g., pets&#39; eyes and ears, human extremities) while not compromising pet&#39;s mobility but rather improving it. The treads on the caps&#39; tips increase the coefficient of friction between the caps (i.e., individual pet&#39;s nails) and the hard-surface flooring improving traction and overall pet&#39;s mobility. Internal spirals allow the caps to twist onto pets&#39; nails and stay securely attached.

# Fabric-Safe Nail Cap Applicator for Feline Claw Protection

## 1. Title of Invention

Fabric-Safe Nail Cap Applicator for Feline Claw Protection

## 2. Field of the Invention

The present invention relates to the field of pet grooming and care, specifically to a device for the safe and efficient application of protective nail caps onto the claws of felines, such as cats and kittens.

## 3. Background of the Invention

Feline claws can cause significant damage to furniture, carpets, and other household items due to their natural scratching behavior. While declawing procedures have been traditionally used to address this issue, they are increasingly being discouraged due to concerns over the potential negative impact on the cat's well-being. As a result, there is a growing demand for humane alternatives that protect both the cat and the owner's belongings.

One such alternative is the use of protective nail caps, which are small, plastic sheaths that are placed over the cat's nails, effectively blunting them and preventing scratching. However, the process of applying these nail caps can be challenging, often leading to resistance and discomfort for the cat, as well as frustration for the owner.

Existing methods for applying nail caps typically involve holding the cat's paw firmly, which can cause stress and anxiety for the animal. Additionally, aligning the caps correctly onto the nails can be time-consuming and prone to errors, resulting in poorly fitted caps that may fall off or cause further discomfort.

The device features a soft, fabric-lined cradle that gently holds the cat's paw in place, minimizing resistance and discomfort during the application process.

At the core of the invention is a cartridge system that houses the nail caps in perfect alignment with the cat's nails. The caps are preloaded into the cartridge, ensuring a smooth and efficient application process. As the cat's paw rests comfortably in the cradle, a gentle pressing mechanism secures the caps onto each nail, providing a secure and long-lasting fit.

To further enhance the positive experience for the cat, the fabric-safe nail cap applicator incorporates a treat dispenser. This innovative feature allows the owner to reward the cat with a tasty treat during the application process, reinforcing good behavior and creating a positive association with the experience.
