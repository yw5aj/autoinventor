## 6. Detailed Description of the Invention

The present invention discloses a modular 3D printed prosthetic leg with interchangeable components, designed to provide a customizable, adaptable, and cost-effective solution for individuals requiring a lower limb prosthesis.

The central component of the invention is the core or frame, which serves as the main structural component to which the various other components, such as the foot, ankle, knee, and socket, can be attached or detached using a standardized connection system.

The core or frame is 3D printed using lightweight yet strong and durable materials, such as carbon fiber-reinforced polymers or titanium alloys. The core may feature an internal structural lattice or honeycomb pattern to optimize the strength-to-weight ratio and provide a degree of shock absorption. The internal structure can be customized based on the user's weight, activity level, and other specific requirements.

The various components, such as the foot, ankle, knee, and socket, are also 3D printed using materials tailored to their respective functions. For example, the foot component may be printed using flexible and shock-absorbing materials, such as thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) or elastomeric resins, to mimic the natural cushioning of a human foot. The knee component, on the other hand, may incorporate rigid and durable materials, such as carbon fiber-reinforced polymers or titanium alloys, to provide enhanced stability and load-bearing capacity.

The standardized connection system is a crucial aspect of the invention, as it enables the seamless integration and interchangeability of the components. This connection system can be achieved through various means, including quick-release mechanisms, threaded connections, or other secure and robust attachment methods. The connection system ensures a secure and stable attachment of the components while also enabling easy disassembly and replacement when necessary.

The modular design of the prosthetic leg offers several advantages:

1. **Customization**: Users can customize the prosthetic leg by selecting and combining different components based on their specific needs, activities, or preferences. For example, a user may choose a more flexible and shock-absorbing foot component for running or a more rigid and stable knee component for hiking.

2. **Replacement and Upgradability**: Worn-out or damaged components can be easily replaced without having to replace the entire prosthetic leg, reducing maintenance costs and downtime. Additionally, users can upgrade individual components as new and improved versions become available.

3. **Adaptability**: Users can swap out components to adapt the prosthetic leg for different activities or terrains, such as hiking, running, or water sports. This flexibility allows for a single prosthetic leg to serve multiple purposes.

4. **Cost-effectiveness**: The modular approach allows for the replacement of only the necessary components, reducing the overall cost compared to purchasing a completely new prosthetic leg.

5. **Personalization**: The 3D printing technology enables the customization of component sizes, shapes, and features to ensure a personalized and comfortable fit for each user. This can be achieved by scanning and modeling the user's residual limb and incorporating those measurements into the design of the socket component.

The 3D printing process used to manufacture the prosthetic leg and its components offers additional advantages, such as reduced lead times, lower production costs, and the ability to produce complex geometries and internal structures that would be challenging or impossible to achieve with traditional manufacturing methods.
